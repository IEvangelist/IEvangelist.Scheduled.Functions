# 6. Azure Function
## Scheduled & HTTP Trigger

Azure Functions are hosted on a serverless infrastructure.

> Serverless computing is the abstraction of servers, infrastructure, and operating systems. When you build serverless apps you donâ€™t need to provision and manage any servers, so you can take your mind off infrastructure concerns. 

#### a. `DoSomething`
The `DoSomething` function wakes up on a schedule and... well... does something. It simply logs out a message indicating when it was executed. No very exciting, but certainly does what it was written to do.

#### b. `TellJoke`

The `TellJoke` function is a little more fun. It leverages the "Internet Chuck Norris Database" to randomly return a joke for a named individual.

__Example Output__
```yaml
Hey, Dave... I have a joke for you. Chuck Norris's keyboard has the Any key.
```
